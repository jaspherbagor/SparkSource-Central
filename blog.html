                <figcaption class="text-center">Examples of Electrical Hazards</figcaption>
                <h3 class="mt-4">Overhead Power Lines</h3>
                <p>Overhead powered and energized electrical lines have high voltages which can cause major burns and electrocution to workers. Remember to maintain a minimum distance of 10 feet from overhead power lines and nearby equipment. Conduct site surveys to ensure that nothing is stored under overhead power lines.</p>
                <p>In addition, safety barriers and signs must be installed to warn nearby non-electrical workers of the hazards present in the area.</p>
                <h3>Damaged Tools and Equipment</h3>
                <p>Exposure to damaged electrical tools and equipment can be very dangerous. Do not fix anything unless you are qualified to do so. Thoroughly check for cracks, cuts, or abrasions on cables, wires, and cords. In case of any defects, have them repaired or replaced.</p>
                <p>Aside from this, Lock Out Tag Out (LOTO) procedures should be performed at all times before commencing electrical maintenance and repairs. LOTO procedures are there to protect all workers on a worksite.</p>
                <h3>Inadequate Wiring and Overloaded Circuits</h3>
                <p>Using wires of inappropriate size for the current can cause overheating and electrical fires to occur. To prevent this, use the correct wire suitable for the operation and the electrical load to work on. Use the correct extension cord designed for heavy-duty use.</p>
                <p>Make sure to not overload an outlet and use proper circuit breakers. Perform regular fire risk assessments to identify areas at risk of bad wiring and circuits.</p>
                <h3>Exposed Electrical Parts</h3>
                <p>Examples of exposed electrical parts include temporary lighting, open power distribution units, and detached insulation parts on electrical cords. These hazards can cause potential shocks and burns. Secure these items with proper guarding mechanisms and always check for any exposed parts to be repaired immediately.</p>
                <h3>Improper Grounding</h3>
                <p>The most common OSHA electrical violation is the improper grounding of equipment. Proper grounding can eliminate unwanted voltage and reduce the risk of electrocution. Never remove the metallic ground pin as it is responsible for returning unwanted voltage to the ground.</p>
                <h3>Damaged Insulation</h3>
                <p>Defective or inadequate insulation is a hazard. Be aware of damaged insulation and report it immediately. Turn off all power sources before replacing damaged insulation and never attempt to cover them with electrical tape.</p>
                <h3>Wet Conditions</h3>
                <p>Never operate electrical equipment in wet locations. Water greatly increases the risk of electrocution especially if the equipment has damaged insulation. Have a qualified electrician inspect electrical equipment that has gotten wet before energizing it.</p>
